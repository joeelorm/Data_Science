In the example you just worked through, the experiment consisted of 500 people visiting Live-it-LIVE.com. For each of those trials (visitors), we expected a 10% chance of a purchase (success), but observed only 41 successes (less than 10%).\n",

    "binom_test() requires three inputs, the number of observed successes, the number of total trials, and an expected probability of success. For example, with 10 flips of a fair coin (trials), the expected probability of heads is 0.5. Let’s imagine we get 2 heads (observed successes) in 10 flips. Is the coin weighted?

For example, suppose that we’re developing a new quiz question at Codecademy and want learners to have a 70% chance of getting the question right (higher would mean the question is too easy, lower would mean the question is too hard). We show our quiz question to a sample of 100 learners and 60 of them get it right. Is this significantly different from our target of 70%? If so, we want to remove the question and try to rewrite it.\n",
