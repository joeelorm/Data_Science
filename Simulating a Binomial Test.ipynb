    "#### Binomial Testing with SciPy\n",
    "More formally, the binomial distribution describes the number of expected “successes” in an experiment with some number of “trials”. In the example you just worked through, the experiment consisted of 500 people visiting Live-it-LIVE.com. For each of those trials (visitors), we expected a 10% chance of a purchase (success), but observed only 41 successes (less than 10%).\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy has a function called binom_test(), which performs a binomial test for you. The default alternative hypothesis for the binom_test() function is two-sided, but this can be changed using the alternative parameter (eg., alternative = 'less' will run a one-sided lower tail test).\n",
    "\n",
    "binom_test() requires three inputs, the number of observed successes, the number of total trials, and an expected probability of success. For example, with 10 flips of a fair coin (trials), the expected probability of heads is 0.5. Let’s imagine we get 2 heads (observed successes) in 10 flips. Is the coin weighted? The function call for this binomial test would look like:"

For example, suppose that we’re developing a new quiz question at Codecademy and want learners to have a 70% chance of getting the question right (higher would mean the question is too easy, lower would mean the question is too hard). We show our quiz question to a sample of 100 learners and 60 of them get it right. Is this significantly different from our target of 70%? If so, we want to remove the question and try to rewrite it.\n",

P-values that are less than this threshold are considered “significant”, while larger p-values are considered “not significant”."
