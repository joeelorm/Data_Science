    "- Is the average amount of money that customers spend on a purchase more than 10 USD?\n",

    "As an example, letâ€™s imagine the fictional business BuyPie, which sends ingredients for pies to your household so that you can make them from scratch. Suppose that a product manager wants online BuyPie orders to cost around 1000 Rupees on average. In the past day, 50 people made an online purchase and the average payment per order was less than 1000 Rupees. Are people really spending less than 1000 Rupees on average? Or is this the result of chance and a small sample size?"
