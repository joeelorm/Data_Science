    "### HISTOGRAMS\n",
    "Statistics is often thought of as a way to find certainty through data. The strength of statistics is more often used to communicate that certainty does not really exist. It provides tools to communicate how uncertain we are about a problem. There is no better tool to visualize the uncertainty and chaos than a histogram. A histogram displays the distribution of your underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms reveal through numbers, interpretable trends in your data. They don't provide a `yes` or `no` answer, but are often used as a starting point for discussion and informing an answer to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summarizing your data\n",
    "The purpose of a histogram is to summarize data that you can use to inform a decision or explain a distribution.While a histogram is one of the most useful tools for communicating trends, people often use the average of a dataset to make broad claims about its underlying trends.While the average value of data may be useful to interpret where the data is centered, it can also be misleading."
